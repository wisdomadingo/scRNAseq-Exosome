```

2.  Download the workshop material by clicking [here](https://github.com/sagc-bioinformatics/Bulk_RNAseq/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unzip the folder.

-   Click on the `Bulk_RNAseq.Rproj` file to open up the R project in RStudio.
-   Navigate to the `analysis` folder, and click the `de.Rmd` file to open up the analysis in RStudio.
-   Also, navigate to the `docs` folder, and click on the `de.html` file to open up the analysis documentation in a web browser.

3.  In the RStudio Console, run the following lines of code to download and install all required packages using `renv`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
renv::restore(library = "./rlib/")
.libPaths( c( .libPaths(), "./rlib") )
```
